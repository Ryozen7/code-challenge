1. getPriority(blockchain: any) uses any and is recomputed repeatedly
    Using any disables TypeScript’s safety.
    The function is recreated on every render.
    Called multiple times unnecessarily during sorting.

2. Incorrect filter logic + unnecessary work inside useMemo.
Variable lhsPriority is referenced but never defined → runtime error.
Filter logic is reversed and confusing:

3. Sorting logic is missing a return value for equal priorities.

4. Incorrect hook dependency list
useMemo depends on: [balances, prices], But prices is never used inside the memoized callback → causes unnecessary recomputation.
5. formattedBalances never used.
6. Double mapping of balances (N + N iterations)
formattedBalances map
rows map
Two passes over the same data when one would do.
7. JSX key is index-based
Using array index as key causes:
Unstable list rendering
Wasted re-renders
Should use a stable unique property like currency or blockchain.
8. Missing type properties
Filtering and sorting access: balance.blockchain
But WalletBalance interface does not define blockchain.
This will fail TypeScript.
The interfaces are incorrect.

9. No null/undefined checks for prices
This line may throw error: prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount
if price is missing.

10. Repeated getPriority calls
Each item is passed through getPriority multiple times (filter + sort).
